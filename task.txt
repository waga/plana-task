Problem to solve: Retrieve and display coordinates 
(longitude and latitude) for an address, 
using Google Maps and OpenStreetMap (OSM). 
Show results from both Google Maps and OSM.

Requirements:

1) Frontend - Angular 2 application with the ability to 
enter the address manually and display the results.

2) Backend - PHP application using OOP. 
Make the implementation easily expandable, 
with ability to add additional APIs to 
retrieve coordinates by address. 
Write some unit tests.

What we are looking for:

1) Frontend - Knowledge to create, expand 
and support Angular 2 applications.

2) Backend - Knowledge of Software Design Patterns. 
Avoid writing hard-coded dependencies, write modular, 
testable and maintainable code.

We expect that the amount of effort, 
to create a solution for this task, 
is in the range of about 4-6 hours of actual work.

Send us a link to your code on GitHub. 
Make sure your submission includes a small README, 
documenting any assumptions, simplifications and/or 
choices you made, as well as a short description 
of how to run the code and/or tests.
